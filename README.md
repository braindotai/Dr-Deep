# Dr-Deep
This repository provides AI based medical services to help doctors diagnose patients easily, accuratly, with much efficiency and without any human error. The computer vision has already outperformed human vision in 2015, so there is literally no reason left to not to use such technology for medical purposes. This project is growing right now, with much more data and compute power we are constantly making more services, and improving existing services. All the datasets we use to train our models are from official institutions.

Key reasons to use our plateform:

- We keep updating our existing models and building more types of medical applications for better versatility.
- We use latest state of the art deep learning based architectures and approaches for maximum accuracy.
- Our plateform is non-profit and provides entirely free services with zero subscription fee for anyone, anywhere on the planet!
- Out plateform will be open source soon so that anyone can contribute to improve and make our plateform more reliable and better.
